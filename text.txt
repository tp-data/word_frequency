When Prince Peter became the ruler of Russia in the 1600s, he realized that his country had fallen behind others. Countries to the west had increased their knowledge and technology. They had advanced, but Russia had not. Peter decided that he had to push his nation forward. To do this, he knew that he would have to change himself first. So Peter took a trip through Europe. People there thought he was very strange. Even though he was a monarch, he did not behave like one. Instead of going to parties, Peter spent his time learning. For example, he enjoyed spending time at the docks learning how to build ships.
